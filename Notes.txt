----TODO----
1. Controllers
2. Routes 
3. Testing
4. Find a way to handle images
    4a. Could use formidable and form data to pass images.
    4b. Could have static profile images on the front that the user can choose from
        - this would mean the photo path would be a string to the file path rather than allowing custom images


----COMPLETED----
1. Packages Installed
2. Git Repository 
3. Index.js Setup
4. File Structure 
5. Models Completed
6. Create MongoDB data base and connect 



----Thoughts----
. The way Admin should work is if they are owner of the team they will have full admin privileges within that team.
. Super Admin will be able to CRUD everything 
. Admin should probably be removed from the user and put on the team instead of permissions 
. If this is done their should be an Admin / Super Admin here.  Super Admin is creator of team and can full CRUD over team/projects/issues. Admin will have same 
    privileges but wont be able to remove Super Admin
. Follow the permissions idea 
. How to cascade based on a delete.

. Figure out a way for those that are permitted to give access to others who need it while not being able to remove the creator of the project
