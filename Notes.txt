----TODO----
1. Controllers
2. Routes 
3. Testing
4. Find a way to handle images
    4a. Could use formidable and form data to pass images.
    4b. Could have static profile images on the front that the user can choose from
        - this would mean the photo path would be a string to the file path rather than allowing custom images
